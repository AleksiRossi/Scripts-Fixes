These files are used in conjuction to allow monitoring of a host behind a vpn tunnel which Nagios can't access.
The script is run on a remote host which nagios can access and that is inside the vpn tunnel. 

Run the script every minute via cron. It ping the host you try to reach and write a log based on whether the ping
was succesful or not. On success, it will write "Online" into the log, on failure "Offline". The script will 
overwrite the previous entry whenever it is ran.

You will need a Nagios server and NRPE installed on both server and on the remote client you run the script on.
The Nagios plugin needs to be on the remote client. Afterwards you can connect to the client from the Nagios server
via NRPE and call the plugin. It will then check whether the host behind the tunnel is pingable from the remote client
and post the info into Nagios web interface (granted you can configured Nagios and added host and service for the client
and the check).
